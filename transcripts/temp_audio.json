    "text": " It's pushing the water and there's a jogger actually look at this wow the Florida man right there for you Blake jogging in the hurricane I was born in it molded by it I didn't see the light until I was already a man but then it was nothing to me but blinding the shadows betray you because they belong to me and you didn't learn your limitations I have no limitations this has to be in you something in you has to wake up and usually the only person that will wake it up is you be the hero of your own movie if your life was a movie and it started now forget about whatever financial disasters you've had personal failures relationship failures what would the hero of your life's movie do right now do that do those things you have many gifts and there is a gift what is in here is a gift you do not think like other men you are unpredictable and that will serve you well use your anger intelligently and I promise you my son the one day the whole world will know and fear my father's powerless did no fucking passion no fucking motivation there's no oh my god man I fucking listen no it's every day of your life just do we no passion no discipline no motivation I've never really viewed myself as particularly talented I've viewed myself as you know slightly above average in talent and where I excel is ridiculous sickening work ethic you know while the other guy's sleeping I'm working what other guys eaten I'm working you will not work me and what you have to decide in your position and the NCA you have to make a decision that nobody in this league in your position will I work you we're up here because of 4 a.m we're up here because of two of days we're five of days we're up here because we had a dream and let nothing stand in our way if anything tried to bring us down we used it to make a strong we were never satisfied never finished we'll never be retired for me anger was good anger was good because it was motivating the more I could create an enemy the more I wanted to go and kill those guys now I knew I was gonna kill them physically but man if I could just what did they say you know and what did they look like they just defend it all you know and to do that if you want something bad enough we can't let anybody tell you we can't do something I'll repeat that if you want something bad enough you can't let anybody tell you you can't do something not even yourself a lot of days I'm like oh you can't do this problem you can't be as quick as a 30 year old on the computer oh shit let me show you I would have arguments with myself I could do it people doubted me I doubted myself sometimes too and you're gonna fail then you're gonna fail and you're gonna fail and you're gonna fail and then you're gonna win if you are experiencing a losing season right now understand that there's a winning season around the corner but you have to be an active participant in getting yourself out of the losing season you would never succeed more than you thought that's not how it works you know why because failure is a wonderful decision it's the only way to learn you have to fail failure is a part of the process to become successful the only way you're ever going to get to the other side of this journey is you have got to do suffer to grow to grow you must suffer and some people get it some alone three a moment of pain sports a lifetime is boring remember that you know what they write about they write about you make so just what do you get to fail and fail and fail and fail and all you gotta do is make more everyone is jealous of what you've got no one is jealous of how you've got him people see the trophies but not the trend everybody wants the view but no one wants the car you have an opportunity right now that you never had people say why you're blind so are you I might not be the number one more professionals people in the world are five years and now I gotta get everything I think here right now every book after life at listen to my school is being paid for by the athletic department oh my god interested people watch obsessed people change if you fall down rough winter floor who cares who cares but if you make it I care I want that I want you to fail I want you to get up and do it again the same thing in life it's the same thing here if you can do this you can do anything anything everything counts everything that you do counts the biggest mistake that people make is they think that only what they want to count counts now and when you read a book when you listen to an audio program when you go to a course when you go to bed early and get up early and you work they all counts and it's all going on the plus side of your ledger but when you watch television waste time hang out full around and so on all of that counts as well imagine you're on your deathbed and standing around your deathbed are the ghosts representing your unfulfilled potential the ghost of the ideas you never acted on the ghost of the talents you didn't use and they're standing around your bed angry disappointed and upset they say we came to you because you could have brought us to life they say and now we have to go to the grave together rest at the end not in the middle",
